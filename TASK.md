# TASK: StreamCanvas Editor — UX Audit & Fixes
> Created: 2026-07-21 | Updated: 2026-07-21

## Goal
Audit + improve UX/correctness of the StreamCanvas Qt6 editor (plan approved, see PLAN.md).
Per user redirect: engine-related fixes go in the separate engine clone
`~/Projects/obs-graphics-engine` (master, dirty tree — touch only serialization/asset code),
then the editor's submodule is bumped to consume them. Editor branch: `ux-audit-fixes`.
Dark-only theme. Rotation & multi-select deferred.

## Plan
### Engine (~/Projects/obs-graphics-engine)
- [x] E1: Expose ParseElement/SerializeElement as public `ogt::` API (title.h/.cpp) — VERIFIED
- [x] E2: Title::Save missing-asset — throws (path listed), no broken .ogt — VERIFIED
- [x] E3: Title::Save basename collision — de-dupe to `@name`/`@name_1` — VERIFIED
- [x] E4: `.ogt` title.json `version:1` field (write + tolerant read/warn) — VERIFIED
### Editor (obs-graphics-editor)
- [x] P0-1: Refactor elementToJson/insertElementFromJson to call `ogt::` API — VERIFIED
      (mirror of E1 applied to submodule working tree; formal submodule bump pending)
- [ ] P0-2: selection retargets wrong element after delete/reorder
- [ ] P0-3: ID rename not undoable + corrupts undo history
- [ ] P0-4: editor-side missing-asset validation (complements E2)
- [ ] P1-1..7: shortcuts, hit-slack, tree reset, undo merge, error surfacing, palette colors, DPR
- [ ] Delete dead ui/graphicproperties.{h,cpp}

## Log
### 2026-07-21
- Branch `ux-audit-fixes` created (exit 0); engine submodule populated (48 files); editor
  built clean via background cmake (exit 0).
- Verified: engine already serializes data_anim (title.cpp:650-655 master) — the loss is the
  editor's DUPLICATE serializer. `mask` is documented but unimplemented in engine (0 matches).
- Engine `ParseElement` (title.cpp:422) / `SerializeElement` (:599, takes AssetRegFn) are
  `static`; editor must reuse via new public wrappers passing identity asset callback.
- `~/Projects/obs-graphics-engine` = master 934cef4 (ahead of submodule 6db8ded), tree dirty
  with unrelated CI/CMake/LICENSE edits — commit only serialization/asset files.

## Log (verification)
### 2026-07-21 — E1 + P0-1
- Engine E1 built clean (implementer, `cmake --build build --target engine` exit 0).
- Editor P0-1 built clean (`cmake --build build` exit 0, ninja). Reviewer APPROVED round-trip.
- Deterministic proof: scratchpad/roundtrip.cpp links build/engine/libengine.a, exercises
  ogt::SerializeElement + ogt::ParseElement → `ALL PASS (failures=0)`, run exit 0.
  Confirmed survive: data_anim_in/out (type/easing/duration/delay), scale_mode "tile" +
  image_tile_scale, text_align_x "justify", raw image path. JSON dump inspected.
- Bonus: old editor kScaleModeStr[] had no "tile" entry (out-of-bounds for ScaleMode::Tile) —
  now fixed by delegating to engine ScaleModeToStr.
### 2026-07-21 — E2/E3/E4
- Engine built clean (implementer, exit 0). Diff reviewed (65+/5-, title.cpp only).
- Deterministic proof: scratchpad/save_test.cpp links engine build/libengine.a + minizip →
  `SAVE-LOGIC PASS (failures=0)`, run exit 0. Verified via `unzip`: title.json `version=1`;
  two same-basename assets archived as logo.png + logo_1.png (@logo.png / @logo_1.png);
  missing asset → Save throws with path, no .ogt written.
- Submodule jump 6db8ded→934cef4 = 5 Lua/HTTP commits (compiled out, LUA OFF) + dormant
  data-source polling; NO serialization change. Bumping editor to master+commit is safe.

## Unverified / Pending
- GUI smoke (launch editor, copy/paste/undo/save) NOT yet run — deferred to one session after
  submodule bump so multiple items verify together.
- Submodule handoff (commit E1..E4 in engine → push → bump editor submodule) NOT done; will
  surface to user before pushing to their MIT origin. Editor P0-1 changes therefore uncommitted.

## Errors & Fixes
| Error | Cause | Fix | Evidence |
|-------|-------|-----|----------|
| (none yet) | | | |

## Current State
Plan approved + reshaped after user redirect: engine (de)serializer is the single source of
truth; editor's lossy duplicate will be replaced by calls into a newly-exposed `ogt::` engine
API. Engine work happens in ~/Projects/obs-graphics-engine (master, dirty — surgical commits
only). Next: E1 (expose ParseElement/SerializeElement), build-verify engine, then bump the
editor submodule and refactor elementToJson/insertElementFromJson (P0-1). All prior state
(branch, build) verified in Log.
